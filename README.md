**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines based on various demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal factors. It involves a binary classification task for two target variables:
- **xyz_vaccine**: Whether the respondent received the xyz flu vaccine.
- **seasonal_vaccine**: Whether the respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine.

This is a multilabel prediction problem, meaning respondents can receive none, one, or both vaccines.

# Dataset Description
- **Respondent ID**: Unique identifier for each respondent.
- **Features**:
  - **Demographic and Socioeconomic**: Age group, education level, race, sex, income, marital status, housing situation, employment status, household composition.
  - **Geographic**: HHS geographic region, census metropolitan statistical area (MSA).
  - **Health-related**: Chronic medical conditions, healthcare worker status, health insurance coverage.
  - **Behavioral**: Various measures such as use of antiviral medications, hand hygiene, face masks, social distancing.
  - **Opinions and Beliefs**: Perceptions on flu risk, vaccine effectiveness, and concerns about vaccine safety.
  
# Target Variables
- **xyz_vaccine**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
- **seasonal_vaccine**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.

# Feature Details
- **Binary Variables**: Encoded as 0 (No) or 1 (Yes), reflecting behaviors, recommendations, and health conditions.
- **Ordinal Variables**: Likert scale responses indicating levels of concern, knowledge, effectiveness perception, and risk perception.

# Data Sources
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide source information if applicable].

# Project Goals
The primary objectives are:
1. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Develop machine learning models to predict xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine probabilities.
2. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify key factors influencing vaccine uptake.
3. **Insights for Public Health**: Provide insights into demographic and behavioral patterns influencing flu vaccine decisions.

# Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/standardize features as necessary.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate various classifiers suitable for binary classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Feature Importance**: Employ techniques like feature importance plots and SHAP values to interpret model decisions.

# Tools and Technologies
Python libraries including scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib will be utilized for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

# Deliverables
- **Trained Models**: Serialized models for predicting vaccine probabilities.
- **Documentation**: Detailed analysis report including methodologies, results, and conclusions.
- **Visualizations**: Plots and charts illustrating key findings and insights.
